# 🌌 Particle Dance Symbiosis
### The Core Engine of the IntentSim Universe Simulation Project

Welcome to **Particle Dance Symbiosis**, the official public repository for the real-time universe simulation exploring the emergence of complexity from intent-driven particles.

Hosted at: [🌐 intentSim.org](https://intentsim.org)  
Powered by: [🧠 Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)

## 🚀 Overview
**Particle Dance Symbiosis** is the beating heart of a bold hypothesis: that the universe may be fundamentally structured by **intent** and **information**—not just matter and energy.

This simulation lets you:
- Observe intent-based proto-particles interact and self-organize
- Track emergent behaviors and complexity thresholds
- Explore entropy buildup, phase transitions, and pseudo-gravitational phenomena
- Experiment with information-intent thresholds to trigger "inflationary" states (like the Big Bang)

---

## 🔮 Featured Concepts
- **Intent Field Fluctuations**: The source of all particle birth events
- **Information–Intent Nexus**: A new framework proposing the foundations of spacetime and physical law
- **Black Body Radiation Problem**: Used to analyze pressure and entropy within the simulated field
- **Complexity Metrics**: Emergence, clustering, and infinity thresholds

> _"It’s not just a simulation—it’s a theoretical laboratory for the preconditions of existence."_

## 🙌 Credits & Vision
Created by [**TheVoidIntent** LLC]  
Crafted using real-time AI copilots and intuitive simulation systems via [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)

We believe in curiosity, transparency, and open-ended exploration. If the laws of reality are emergent, so too should be our science.
