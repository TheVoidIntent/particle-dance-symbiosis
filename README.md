## ✨ What is This?

**Particle Dance Symbiosis** is the beating heart of [IntentSim.org](https://intentsim.org), a persistent universe simulation built to explore a radical hypothesis:

> The fundamental fabric of reality is structured by an interplay between **Information** and **Intent** — not matter and energy alone.

This project simulates an emergent universe where particles are born through intent-field fluctuations, evolve based on knowledge-seeking behavior, and self-organize into increasingly complex clusters — much like early cosmology, but reimagined through intent.

## 🧪 Core Features

- 🔁 **24/7 Persistent Universe** — No resets. Complexity compounds over time.
- 🧠 **Intent-Based Particles** — Entities evolve by learning from interactions.
- 📊 **Real-Time Stats** — Entropy, interactions, complexity levels.
- 🚨 **Infinity & Anomalies** — Phase transitions trigger inflation-like effects.
- 🔍 **Entropy Visualizer** — Black-body overlays & entropy-pressure mapping.
- 📦 **Data Export** — Download live simulation datasets and visuals.
- 🌌 **Information–Intent Nexus Framework** — Full hypothesis inside.

## 🧬 Information–Intent Nexus

> “Instead of asking what the universe is made of, we ask what it **wants** to become.”

Our theory proposes that intent is the generative force behind physical law, and information acts as the shaping constraint. The Nexus model links entropy, clustering, and emergent gravity-like phenomena.
