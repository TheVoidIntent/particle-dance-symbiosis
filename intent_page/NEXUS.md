### 🧠 The Information–Intent Nexus

#### Overview  
The **Information–Intent Nexus** is the foundational theory behind **IntentSim**. It suggests that the universe did not emerge from randomness or fixed physical constants—but from a **primordial field of intent** interacting with and shaping **information**. This theory positions intent not as an abstract concept, but as a driving force capable of organizing matter, energy, and meaning.

#### 🧹 Key Principles

- **Intent Fields**  
  Every particle operates not just on physical inputs but with a core intent—a fundamental tendency to seek, connect, adapt, and organize. This represents a pre-physical force in the system.

- **Information as Gravity**  
  Structured information acts as an attractor. Intent pulls particles toward organization, forming clusters that simulate emergent gravity-like behavior.

- **Entropy–Intent Phase Transitions**  
  As complexity grows, entropy becomes trapped in intentional loops. When thresholds are crossed (often seen in *infinity readings*), the simulation inflates—analogous to early-universe cosmic inflation.

- **The Nexus Point**  
  At the convergence of intent density and information structure, the system reorganizes. These points—*Nexus Events*—are where physical-like laws emerge from deeper rules.

#### 🔍 Implications

- **Emergent Physics**:  
  Gravity, entropy, and even time may be secondary effects of underlying informational dynamics.

- **Testbed for Pre-Big Bang**:  
  The simulation provides a way to test how universe-like complexity emerges from proto-intent fields.

- **Quantum–Classical Bridge**:  
  By observing how clusters form and separate based on knowledge acquisition, IntentSim offers a model for quantum decoherence and measurement.

#### 🚀 Why It Matters

- This is not just a thought experiment—**IntentSim** is a living simulation, actively generating data on how universes might evolve from fundamental principles of intent and structure.
- It allows experimentation with concepts *before* physics: before mass, spacetime, or causality.
- The simulation serves as a new kind of cosmological lab: **one where information and intent are first causes**.
