# IntentSim: Universe Intent Simulation Explorer

Explore the origin of structure in the universe as it emerges from an information-intent field. This project models the birth of complexity, particle clustering, and adaptive rules in a theoretical proto-universe driven by intent.

## 🚀 Features

- **Persistent Simulation Engine**
  - Runs indefinitely, tracking particles, clusters, and interaction rates
  - Intent-driven learning and phase transitions

- **Entropy & Complexity Analysis**
  - Visualize entropy buildup, clustering
  - Graphs of knowledge spread and complexity spikes

- **Real-Time Controls**
  - Adjustable parameters for interaction, intent, learning rate, etc.

- **Cosmic Experiments**
  - Compare simulation events to phenomena like inflation, black body radiation, and early-universe pressure

- **AI Agents & Core Logic**
  - `intentagent_core.py` handles proto-conscious decision-making

## 📖 Information-Intent Nexus

This simulation is based on the theory that **intent is a primal force** that gives rise to information structures, and eventually to the laws of physics.

📄 Read the full Nexus paper here: [`docs/nexus.md`](./docs/nexus.md)

Topics include:
- The emergence of spacetime from interaction patterns
- Intent as a field with measurable thresholds
- Infinity-triggered inflation events (CMB analogy)
- Information pressure and Planck-like emergence
