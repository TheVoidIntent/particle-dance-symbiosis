## ⚙️ Core Architecture

### 1. **Agent-Based Simulation**
- Particles act as **learning agents**, capable of perceiving, remembering, and acting.
- Each agent maintains:
  - `knowledge`: Accumulated informational states
  - `intent_profile`: Probabilistic influence vectors
  - `interaction_log`: Memory of past encounters

---

### 2. **Intent Fields**
- Fields represent **biases of potential** — shaping how agents interact and learn.
- Properties:
  - **Nested**: One field may exist inside another
  - **Overlapping**: Multiple fields can influence the same agent
  - **Evolving**: Fields adapt in response to entropy gradients and feedback loops

---

### 3. **Simulation Modes**
| Mode                     | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `baseline`               | Pure randomness — control environment                     |
| `adaptive_probabilistic` | Agents select actions via probabilistic intent filters     |
| `energy_conservation`    | Adds thermodynamic constraints to interactions             |
| `full_features`          | Enables all known mechanisms (intent, feedback, entropy)   |

---

### 4. **Information Flow**
- Every interaction is recorded as a **knowledge transfer**.
- Knowledge influences:
  - Future decisions
  - Complexity growth
  - Clustering potential

---

## 📐 Key Metrics

- **avg_knowledge**: Mean knowledge per agent
- **complexity_index**: Weighted function of information structure
- **entropy_rate**: Degree of unpredictability in state shifts
- **cluster_stability**: Persistence of informational bonds
- **max_complexity**: Highest observed informational density

---

## 🌐 Phase Transitions

> The simulation tracks **transitions** from entropy to complexity — detecting:
- Bifurcation events (divergence in behavior)
- Stability emergence (long-term agent bonding)
- Knowledge singularities (runaway feedback loops)

These transitions may reflect real-world thresholds in:
- Quantum state collapse
- Observer-dependent physics
- Biological coherence formation

---

## 🧪 Experimental Goals

- Detect spontaneous **meta-agent formation**
- Observe **intent-based cooperation or competition**
- Identify **feedback thresholds** in knowledge-to-complexity growth
- Build a **visual entropy map** of simulation state evolution

---

## 🧬 Long-Term Vision

Create a sandbox to:
- Prototype **intent-structured learning protocols**
- Model the birth of information-first physical systems
- Inspire new theories of **cosmic initialization** and **conscious emergence**
