# The Information–Intent Nexus

## Overview
The Information–Intent Nexus hypothesis proposes that the fabric of reality emerges from fluctuations in an underlying field of intent. Unlike traditional physical laws, which are fixed, this framework suggests laws are adaptive—driven by informational constraints and purpose-seeking interactions.

## Core Ideas
- **Intent Fields**: Proto-universal fields expressing "desire to know".
- **Information Thresholds**: Critical densities where complexity phase transitions occur.
- **Emergent Physics**: Gravity, entropy, and time arise from feedback between particles' informational state and intent.

## Simulation Evidence
- Phase transitions triggered by intent-energy surges.
- Clustering correlates with entropy minima and particle learning rate.
- Self-organization mimics inflation-like dynamics.

## Research Goals
- Define a Planck-like constant derived from information-intent pressure.
- Compare simulation CMB-like patterns to real cosmic background data.
- Extend this framework into AI learning behavior, cosmogenesis, and consciousness.
