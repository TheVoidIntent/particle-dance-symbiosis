## Required Audio Files

The following audio files are expected by the SharedAudioLibrary component. Place your MP3 files here with these exact filenames:

1. `introduction-to-intent-theory.mp3` - Overview of the fundamental concepts
2. `particle-interaction-dynamics.mp3` - Technical explanation of particle interactions
3. `emergent-complexity-patterns.mp3` - Analysis of patterns emerging from simulations
4. `charge-knowledge-transfer.mp3` - How particle charge affects information exchange
5. `simulation-parameters-explained.mp3` - Guide to simulation parameters

## Audio File Specifications

For best results:
- Use MP3 format with 128-256 kbps bitrate
- Keep file sizes below 10MB per file for faster loading
- Ensure clear audio quality for better user experience

## Adding Custom Audio Files

You can also add custom audio files beyond the predefined ones by:
