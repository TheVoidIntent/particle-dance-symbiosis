# Audio Files Directory

This directory is intended for storing audio files for the Intent Universe Framework website.

## Adding Audio Files

Place your audio files in this directory to make them accessible via the SharedAudioLibrary component.
The expected format for the files is:

- `/audio/introduction-to-intent-theory.mp3`
- `/audio/particle-interaction-dynamics.mp3`
- `/audio/emergent-complexity-patterns.mp3`
- `/audio/charge-knowledge-transfer.mp3`
- `/audio/simulation-parameters-explained.mp3`

## Note

The actual audio files are not included in the repository. Site administrators need to add these files manually.
