  "The Information–Intent Nexus is the foundational theory behind IntentSim. It suggests that the universe did not emerge from randomness or fixed physical constants—but from a primordial field of intent interacting with and shaping information.",
  "Intent Fields: Every particle operates not just on physical inputs but with a core intent—a fundamental tendency to seek, connect, adapt, and organize. This represents a pre-physical force in the system.",
  "Information as Gravity: Structured information acts as an attractor. Intent pulls particles toward organization, forming clusters that simulate emergent gravity-like behavior.",
  "Entropy–Intent Phase Transitions: As complexity grows, entropy becomes trapped in intentional loops. When thresholds are crossed (often seen in infinity readings), the simulation inflates—analogous to early-universe cosmic inflation.",
  "The Nexus Point: At the convergence of intent density and information structure, the system reorganizes. These points—Nexus Events—are where physical-like laws emerge from deeper rules.",
  "Emergent Physics: Gravity, entropy, and even time may be secondary effects of underlying informational dynamics.",
  "Testbed for Pre-Big Bang: The simulation provides a way to test how universe-like complexity emerges from proto-intent fields.",
  "Quantum–Classical Bridge: By observing how clusters form and separate based on knowledge acquisition, IntentSim offers a model for quantum decoherence and measurement.",
  "This is not just a thought experiment—IntentSim is a living simulation, actively generating data on how universes might evolve from fundamental principles of intent and structure.",
  "It allows experimentation with concepts before physics: before mass, spacetime, or causality.",
  "The simulation serves as a new kind of cosmological lab: one where information and intent are first causes.",
  "Core Architecture - Agent-Based Simulation: Particles act as learning agents, capable of perceiving, remembering, and acting.",
  "Each agent maintains: knowledge (accumulated informational states), intent_profile (probabilistic influence vectors), and interaction_log (memory of past encounters).",
  "Intent Fields: Fields represent biases of potential — shaping how agents interact and learn. Properties: Nested (one field may exist inside another), Overlapping (multiple fields can influence the same agent), Evolving (fields adapt in response to entropy gradients and feedback loops).",
  "Simulation Modes include: baseline (pure randomness — control environment), adaptive_probabilistic (agents select actions via probabilistic intent filters), energy_conservation (adds thermodynamic constraints to interactions), and full_features (enables all known mechanisms - intent, feedback, entropy).",
  "Information Flow: Every interaction is recorded as a knowledge transfer. Knowledge influences future decisions, complexity growth, and clustering potential.",
  "Key Metrics: avg_knowledge (mean knowledge per agent), complexity_index (weighted function of information structure), entropy_rate (degree of unpredictability in state shifts), cluster_stability (persistence of informational bonds), max_complexity (highest observed informational density).",
  "Phase Transitions: The simulation tracks transitions from entropy to complexity, detecting bifurcation events (divergence in behavior), stability emergence (long-term agent bonding), and knowledge singularities (runaway feedback loops).",
  "These transitions may reflect real-world thresholds in quantum state collapse, observer-dependent physics, and biological coherence formation.",
  "Experimental Goals include detecting spontaneous meta-agent formation, observing intent-based cooperation or competition, identifying feedback thresholds in knowledge-to-complexity growth, and building a visual entropy map."
